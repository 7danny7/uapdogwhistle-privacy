Privacy Policy for UAP Dog Whistle
Last updated: June 10, 2025

Introduction
UAP Dog Whistle (“we”, “us” or “our”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what (if any) information the UAP Dog Whistle mobile application (“the App”) collects, how we use it, and your rights.

1. Information We Collect
No Personal Data Collected.

The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information (name, email, location, device identifiers, etc.).

We do not use any analytics or crash-reporting SDKs.

Local-Only Settings Storage.

We store only two user preferences locally on your device via Jetpack DataStore:

Theme choice (dark/light/aurora/etc.)

Background image URI (if you pick a custom image via the Android Photo Picker)

These settings remain on your device and are never uploaded or shared.

2. Permissions
FOREGROUND_SERVICE: Required to run the audio “whistle” in the background when you’ve pressed “Invite Them”.

Photo Picker: When you choose a custom background, the standard system picker may grant temporary read access to that image. We do not retain or transmit that image to any server.

3. Usage of Data
Because we collect nothing beyond local settings, there is no “usage” to share, analyze, or monetize. Everything runs entirely on-device.

4. Third-Party Libraries
We use only standard AndroidX and Jetpack Compose libraries (and Coil for image loading), none of which collect personal data on our behalf.

5. Data Security
Your local settings are stored in an encrypted preferences file managed by Android’s DataStore.

We do not transmit any data over the network, so there is no risk of server-side breach.

6. Children’s Privacy
Our App is not directed at children under 13. Because we collect no personal information, we do not knowingly process data of children.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will reflect changes.
