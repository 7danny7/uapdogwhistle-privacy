Privacy Policy for UAP Dog Whistle
**Last updated: July 4th, 2025**

### Introduction

UAP Dog Whistle ("we", "us" or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy clearly explains what (if any) information the UAP Dog Whistle mobile application ("the App") collects, how we handle it, and your rights regarding this information.

### Information We Collect

**No Personal Data Collected**
The App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information, including but not limited to your name, email address, physical location, device identifiers, or any other personally identifiable information.

We explicitly do **not** utilize analytics, tracking, advertising, or crash-reporting services.

### Local-Only Settings Storage

The App stores two user-selected preferences exclusively on your device, using Android Jetpack DataStore (stored locally in app-private storage; never transmitted).

* **Theme Choice:** dark, light, aurora, galaxy, night sky, etc.
* **Background Image URI:** when you select a custom image using the Android Photo Picker.

These settings remain securely stored locally and are never uploaded, transmitted, or shared with any third parties.

### Permissions

* **Photo Picker (READ\_MEDIA\_IMAGES):** When selecting a custom background image, the Android system grants temporary, read-only access to the selected image. The selected image remains solely on your device and is never stored permanently, uploaded, or transmitted elsewhere by the App.

### Data Usage

Since the App collects no data beyond locally stored preferences, there is no data available for sharing, analyzing, monetizing, or third-party access. All data remains exclusively local and device-bound.

### Third-Party Libraries and Licenses

We utilize standard AndroidX and Jetpack Compose libraries, as well as the Coil library for image loading. These libraries do not collect, process, or transmit personal data on our behalf. The libraries utilized are open-source, distributed under the Apache License 2.0. Licensing notices are packaged with the app as required.

### Data Security

Your settings and preferences are stored locally in app-private storage using Android’s Jetpack DataStore. Because the App does not transmit any data over networks, there is no risk associated with server-side breaches or data leakage.

### Children's Privacy

The App is not designed for, directed toward, nor intended to attract children under the age of 13. Given our strict policy of no data collection, we do not knowingly process or collect personal information from children under 13.

### Changes to This Policy

We may periodically update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be clearly indicated by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.

UAP Dog Whistle is intended purely as a novelty entertainment application. There is no warranty or guarantee—express or implied—that the App will summon, attract, or enable interaction with any UAP, extraterrestrial entities, or related phenomena. By using the App, you explicitly acknowledge and agree that CatmanSoftwareStudios (including its officers, employees, affiliates, agents, or licensors) shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising from or related to your use of the App. Such damages include, without limitation, personal injury, emotional distress, property damage, loss of data, device malfunctions, or the unexplained disappearance or behavior of household pets or animals.
